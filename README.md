Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" across the entire period
Calculation of changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, followed by the determination of their average
Identification of the highest increase in profits (date and amount) throughout the entire duration
Identification of the most significant decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire timeframe.
